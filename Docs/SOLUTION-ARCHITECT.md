# ReadME

1. Open up the app
   - Shows a list of templates
     - This is done by getting a list of files in the templates folder
2. Open up a template
   - We grab all macros in the template folder and display them as blocks
   - We load up the index.jks file and display it (default)
3. Edit the template
   - Each macro is a tab
   - We can click on a macro and edit it, prepopulating the values from the file

Ignore T3 during development and just work on frontend with dummy data

## Issue

- How do I map macro to a display name?

# Routes

- Get all templates
- Get template
